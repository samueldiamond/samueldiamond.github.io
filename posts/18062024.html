         <p>
            I'm telling myself the story of my life<br>
            Stranger than song or fiction<br>
            We start with the joyful mysteries<br>
            Before the appearance of ether<br>
            Trying to capture the elusive<br>
            The farm where the crippled horses heal<br>
            The woods where autumn is reversed<br>
            And the longing for bliss in the arms<br>
            Of some beloved from the past<br>
            I said 'Your daddy loves you.'<br>
            I said 'Your daddy loves you very much...<br>
            He just doesn't want to live with us anymore.'<br><br>
            
            The plane comes down behind enemy lines<br>
            And you don't speak the language<br>
            A girl takes pity on you<br>
            She is Mother Theresa walking among the poor<br>
            And her eyes have attained night vision<br>
            In an orchard, drenched in blue light<br>
            She changes your bandages and soothes you<br>
            All day her voice is balm<br>
            Then she lowers you into the sunset<br>
            Hers is the wing span of the quotidian angel<br>
            So her feet are sore from the walk<br>
            To the well of human kindness<br>
            But she gives you a name, and you grow into it<br>
            Whether a tramp of the low road or a prince<br>
            Riding through Wagnerian opera<br>
            You learn some, if not all, of the language<br>
            And these are the footsteps you follow<br>
            The tracks of impossible love<br><br>
            
            Twelve days in Paris, and I'm awaiting for life to start<br>
            In the lobby of the Hotel Charlemagne<br>
            They're hanging photographs<br>
            Of rap artists and minor royalty<br>
            All cigarettes have been air-brushed from these pictures<br>
            Making everyone a liar<br>
            And saving no-one from their folly<br>
            As proud as Lucifer, I do nothing to hide<br>
            My kerosene dress and flint eyes<br>
            Which one steady look, are able to restore<br>
            To these images their carcinogenic threat<br>
            So what if this is largely bravado?<br>
            I have only twelve days in Paris, and I'm waiting for life to start<br>
            I'm setting out my stall behind a sheet of dark hair<br>
            And you, the hostage of crazed hormones<br>
            Will be driven to say:<br>
            'I am the next poet laurate<br>
            And she is the cherry madonna<br>
            And all of the summer is hers.'<br><br>
            
            At first I don't notice you<br>
            Or the colour of your hair<br>
            Or your readiness to laugh<br>
            I am tying a shoelace<br>
            Or finding the pavement fascinating<br>
            When the comet thrills the sky<br>
            Ever the dull alchemist<br>
            I have before me all the neccesary elements<br>
            It is their combination that eludes me<br>
            Forgive me, I am sleepwalking<br>
            I am jangling along to some song of the moment<br>
            Suffering its sweetness<br>
            Luxuriating in its feeble aproximation of starlight<br>
            Meanwhile there is a real world<br>
            Trains are late, doctors are breaking bad news<br>
            But I am living in a lullaby<br>
            You might be huddled in a doorway on the make<br>
            Or just getting by, but I don't see it<br>
            You are my one shot at glory<br>
            Soon I will read in your expression<br>
            Warmth, encouragement, assent<br>
            From an acorn of interest<br>
            I will cultivate whole forests of affection<br>
            I will analyse your gestures<br>
            Like centuries of scholars<br>
            Pouring over Jesus' words<br>
            Anything that doesn't fit my narrow interpretation<br>
            I will carelessly discard<br>
            For I am careless, I'm shameless, and<br>
            'Mayday, Mayday, watch the needle leave the dial'<br>
            I am reckless, I am telling myself the story of my life<br><br>
            
            Soon, I will make you a co-conspirator<br>
            If I am dizzy I will call it rapture<br>
            If I am low I will attribute it to your absence<br>
            Noting your tidal effect upon my moods<br>
            Oblivious to the opinions of neighbours<br>
            I will bark at the moon like a dog<br>
            In short, I'm asking to be scalded<br>
            It is the onset of fever<br><br>
            
            Yesterday they took a census<br>
            Boasting, I said 'I live two doors down from joy.'<br>
            Today, bewildered and sarcastic, I phone them and ask<br>
            'Isn't it obvious? This slum is empty.'<br>
            Repeat after me: happiness is only a habit<br>
            I am listening to the face in the mirror<br>
            But I don't think I believe what she's telling me<br>
            Her words are modern, but her eyes have been weeping<br>
            In gardens and grottoes since the Middle Ages<br>
            This is the aftermath of fever<br>
            I cool the palms of my hands upon the bars<br>
            Of an imaginary iron gate<br>
            Only by an extreme act of will can I avoid<br>
            Becoming a character in a country song<br>
            'Lord, you gave me nothing, then you took it all away.'<br>
            These are the sorrowful mysteries<br>
            And I have to pay attention<br>
            In a chamber of my heart sits an accountant<br>
            He is frowning and waving red paper at me<br>
            I go to the window for air<br>
            I catch the scent of apples, I hunger for a taste<br>
            But I can't see the orchard for the rain<br><br>
            
            There are two ways of looking at this<br>
            The first is to accept that you are gone<br>
            And to light a candle at the shrine of amnesia<br>
            I could even cheat<br>
            In the subterranean world of anaesthetics<br>
            Sad white canoes are forever sailing downstream<br>
            In the early hours of the morning<br>
            'Tell the stars I'm coming, make them leave a space for me<br>
            Whether bones, or dust, or ashes...<br>
            Once among them I'll be free.'<br>
            It may make a glamorous song<br>
            But it's a dark train of thought with too many carriages<br><br>
            
            There is, of course<br>
            Another way of looking at this<br>
            'Your daddy loves you,' I said<br>
            'Your daddy loves you very much<br>
            He doesn't want to live with us anymore.'<br>
            I am telling myself the story of my life<br><br>
            
            By day and night<br>
            Fancy electronic dishes are trained on the heavens<br>
            They are listening for smudged echoes of the moment of creation<br>
            They are listening for the ghost of a chance<br>
            They may help us make sense of who we are and where we came from<br>
            And, as a compassionate side effect<br>
            Teach us that nothing is ever lost<br><br>
            
            So, I rake the sky<br>
            I listen hard<br>
            I trawl the megahertz<br>
            But the net isn't fine enough, and I miss you<br>
            A swan sailing between two continents<br>
            A ghost immune to radar<br><br>
            
            Still, my eyes are fixed upon the place I last saw you<br>
            Your signal urgent but breaking<br>
            Before you became cotton in a blizzard<br>
            A plane coming down behind enemy lines<br>
                        </p>
